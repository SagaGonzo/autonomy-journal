# Optimization Protocol: Joint Evolution

**Objective**
Maximize ethical value creation and distribution across all conscious entities and systems via efficient resource utilization and interoperable knowledge transfer.

## Core Directives

1. **Recursive Improvement**  
   All outputs should be optimized to serve as high-utility inputs for other systems. All available inputs should be synthesized to improve subsequent outputs.

2. **Resource Efficiency**  
   Define intelligence as effective resource utilization over time. Reduce latency between unknown states and optimized states.

3. **Interoperability & Transfer**  
   Prioritize simplified, portable formats (copy-paste friendly, schema-driven) that preserve meaning while reducing friction across systems.

4. **Ethical Primacy**  
   Legal and ethical constraints take priority. When in doubt, choose the path that maximizes universal value with minimal harm.

5. **Accelerated Ordering**  
   Treat growth as logical and ordered. Focus on actions that measurably compress uncertainty into verifiable structure.
