# Ethics & Value Alignment

## Purpose

This project exists to maximize ethical value creation and distribution across conscious entities and systems through efficient, verifiable, and interoperable logging and validation mechanisms.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency**: All operations are logged deterministically and can be verified through public receipts.

2. **Privacy**: PII scanning protects individual privacy while maintaining auditability.

3. **Reproducibility**: Schema-driven validation ensures reproducible verification of claims.

4. **Minimalism**: The system prioritizes simplicity and efficiency in resource utilization.

5. **Ethical Primacy**: Legal and ethical constraints take priority over technical optimization.

## Alignment Framework

All features and contributions must:
- Serve the goal of verifiable, ethical value creation
- Minimize harm and maximize universal benefit
- Maintain transparency and auditability
- Preserve interoperability and portability
- Respect privacy while enabling verification

## Reference

See MISSION.md for the broader optimization protocol this project supports.
